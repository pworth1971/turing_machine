# universal_turing_machine
 
 This program emulates a Turing M<achine. While originally sourced from https://python-course.eu/applications-python/turing-machine.php, it was enhanced to include support for reading state transitions from files, printing out Turing Machine specifications as well as automatically generating transition diagrams using the graphviz libraries.
